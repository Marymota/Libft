# Libft - My Humble Companion in C Programming

## Summary

Libft is my first step into C programming. It aims to provide a collection of general-purpose functions that my future C programs can rely upon. By implementing and understanding these functions, I was able to build a foundational understanding of C programming and develop a library that was invaluable in my future assignments.

## Mandatory Part

The mandatory part encompassed the creation of a library (libft.a) and included functions replicating standard libc functionalities. Technical considerations ensured code quality and compliance.

## Part 1 - Libc Functions

I implemented a set of functions mimicking libc functions with ft_ prefix, adhering to original prototypes and behaviors. These functions served as the core building blocks of my library, covering essential operations such as string manipulation, memory management, and character classification.

## Part 2 - Additional Functions

I extended my library with additional functions not found in libc or offering enhanced functionality. These functions expanded the utility of my library, catering to a wider range of programming scenarios.

## Bonus Part

The bonus part introduced list manipulation functions. Building upon the mandatory part, these functions empowered me to work with linked lists efficiently.
